# 🏦 Bank Fraud Detection System (ML + Streamlit)

An end-to-end Machine Learning based Fraud Detection System using 
Isolation Forest and deployed as a real-time web application with Streamlit.

This project simulates how real banking systems detect suspicious 
transactions using anomaly detection techniques.
